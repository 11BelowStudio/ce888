# This is a README

Hello

Long story short, this is a repository for the CE888 *Data Science and Decision-Making*
module I'm just starting as of the time of writing.

There's nothing much here to look at (like, at all), but that might change
eventually.

Probably.

If you want assignment 1, please go to project/data/ for the datasets and the code.
Specifically, the code is in project/data/viewer.ipynb
At minimum, you will need to have Python 3.8 (or later) and jupyter installed in order
to run it. When you start running the notebook, it will attempt to install all of the
other dependencies for you, so you don't need to worry about doing that.

Alternatively, if you want the raw LaTeX files, please go to project/assignment1_report/


If you're here for assignment 2, the assignment 2 notebooks are in /project/assignment2/,
and the report for that (along with the LaTeX files) are in /project/ass2report/
