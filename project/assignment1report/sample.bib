        The Infant Health and Development Program is a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of educational and family support services and pediatric follow-up, offered during the first 3 years of life, in reducing the incidence of developmental delay in low birth weight preterm infants at eight clinical sites (N=985). It was hypothesized that larger intervention effects would be found for the domains in which low birth weight preterm infants are known to have problems, specifically visual-motor and spatial skills and receptive language skills. These analyses explore the effects of the Infant Health and Development Program on different domains of cognitive functioning. Cognitive domains are identified by means of factor analysis of the intelligence tests used at 12,24, and 36 months (Bayley Scales of infant Development (including the Mental and Motor scales) at 12 and 24 months; the Stanford-Binet, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and Beery Test of Visual motor integration at 36 months). Our results reveal that, although intervention benefits accrue across cognitive domains at 24 and 36 months, gains are most pronounced for receptive language and visual-motor and spatial skills.

 abstract = {This paper considers causal inference and sample selection bias in non-experimental settings in which: (i) few units in the non-experimental comparison group are comparable to the treatment units, and (ii) selecting a subset of comparison units similar to the treatment units is difficult because units must be compared across a high-dimensional set of pre-treatment characteristics. We propose the use of propensity score matching methods and implement them using data from the NSW experiment.  Following Lalonde (1986), we pair the experimental treated units with non-experimental comparison units from the CPS and PSID and compare the estimates of the treatment effect obtained using our methods to the benchmark results from the experiment.  We show that the methods succeed in focusing attention on the small subset of the comparison units comparable to the treated units and, hence, in alleviating the bias due to systematic differences between the treated and comparison units.},

We find that estimates of the impact of NSW based on propensity score matching are highly sensitive to both the set of variables included in the scores and the particular analysis sample used in the estimation. Among the estimators we study, the difference-in-differences matching estimator performs the best. We attribute its performance to the fact that it eliminates potential sources of temporally invariant bias present in the NSW data, such as geographic mismatch between participants and nonparticipants and the use of a dependent variable measured in different ways for the two groups. Our analysis demonstrates that while propensity score matching is a potentially useful econometric tool, it does not represent a general solution to the evaluation problem.}
